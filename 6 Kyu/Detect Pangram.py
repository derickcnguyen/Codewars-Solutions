A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.

def is_pangram(s):
    set = []
    s = s.lower()
    for i in s:
        if i.isalpha():
            if i not in set:
                set.append(i)
    return len(set) == 26
