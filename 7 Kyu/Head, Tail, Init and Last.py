Your job is to implement these functions in your given language. Make sure it doesn't edit the array; that would cause problems! Here's a cheat sheet:

| HEAD | <----------- TAIL ------------> |
[  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9,  10]
| <----------- INIT ------------> | LAST |

head [x] = x
tail [x] = []
init [x] = []
last [x] = x

def head(lst):
    return lst[0]

def tail(lst):
    return lst[1:]

def init(lst):
    return lst[:-1]

def last(lst):
    return lst[-1]
